education:
    - degree: BS in Biochemistry
      university: University of Texas at Dallas
      time: 2017 - 2019
      details: |
        I spent my time at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) trying to better understand
        the way the brain and body interact. My course work focused on research biochemistry
        while my spare time was filled with personal research both in and out of books. I was
        lucky enough to work with the wonderful Gassensmith and Price/Dussor labs and learn how to 
        conduct basic and applied research. I finished out my time at UTD as an environmental activist. 
        I worked with a volunteer group partnered with the Audubon Society of Texas to raise awareness about 
        legislation the Audubon Society was supporting. I was involved in community outreach for climate action in the form
        of letters to the editor, teach ins/community classes, and petitioning.
