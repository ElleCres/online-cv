## About
I'm working on making this website fit my needs and personality. Below are credits, the installation instructions I followed, and the personalization options were provided by my experience editing this site. This page currently contains just my resume but will house more content and have an updated front-end soon. 


## Credits
- The Orbit Theme was designed by Xiaoying Riley and can be found, with her other themes, at [3rd Wave Media](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/).
- Sharath Kumar converted Orbit into a Jekyll theme. See his live demo [here](https://online-cv.webjeda.com).
- Thanks to [Nelson EstevÃ£o](https://github.com/nelsonmestevao) for all their [contributions](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/commits?author=nelsonmestevao).
- Thanks to [t-h-e(sfrost)](https://github.com/t-h-e) for all their [contributions](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/commits?author=t-h-e).
- Updated site by Elle Creswell.
- Check out more themes: [**Jekyll Themes**](http://jekyll-themes.com).


## Installation
* [Fork](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/fork) the original repository
* Delete the `gh-pages` branch
* Re-create the `gh-pages` branch
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://username.github.io/online-cv/`
* Choose or tweak any of the skins in /_sass/skins/ to fit your color needs. 
* Watch Sharath's [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2nx6tj-ZH4) for help with set-up.

## Personalization
* Change all your personal details using one file: `_data/data.yml`
* Choose your theme by changing the `theme-skin:` in `_config.yml` to one of the 6 themes. 
* Creating a theme or renaming a theme is as follows: 
   - Create a file titled `_SKINNAME.scss` or edit one the existing theme(s). 
   - Edit the header in your scss file to be `/*SKINNAME variables*/`.
   - Update the hex code values in the scss file to match your desired color scheme. colors can be found and customized by finding the hexcode at [colorhexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/).
   - Change the `theme-skin` in `_config.yml` to `skinname`.

* If you change the theme: go to `_data/data.yml`, find the `footer:>` section at the bottom of the page and change the `updated by <a href="YOURSITE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YOUR NAME</a>` to your information.
