## Installation

* [Fork](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/fork) the original repository
* Delete the `gh-pages` branch
* Re-create the `gh-pages` branch
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://username.github.io/online-cv/`
* Choose or tweak any of the skins in /_sass/skins/ to fit your color needs. 
* Watch Sharath's [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2nx6tj-ZH4) for help with set-up.

## Personalization
* Change all your personal details using one file: ``_data/data.yml``
* For the main Jekyll theme: the skin can be selected by editing ``theme-skin:`` in ``_config.yml``
* For Elle's edit: the ``theme-skin`` is set to lavender. Navigate to ``_sass/skins/_lavender.scss`` and edit the variables or file name. 
* If you change the file name, make sure you do so as follows: ``_SKINNAME.scss``  then also in the header ``/*<i>SKINNAME variables</i>*/`` and change the ``theme-skin`` in ``_config.yml`` to ``skinname``.
* If you change the theme: go to ``_data/data.yml``, find the ``footer:>`` section at the bottom of the page and change the ``updated by <a href="YOURSITE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YOUR NAME</a>`` to your information.
