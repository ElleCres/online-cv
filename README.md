## Installation
* [Fork](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/fork) the original repository
* Delete the `gh-pages` branch
* Re-create the `gh-pages` branch
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.

## Personalization
* Change all your personal details using one file: `_data/data.yml`
* The skin can be selected by editing `theme-skin:` in `_config.yml` to one of the 6 themes. 
* Theme creation is as follows: 
   - Create a file titled `_SKINNAME.scss` or edit one of the existing themes. 
   - Edit the header in your scss file to be `/*<i>SKINNAME variables</i>*/`.
   - Update the hex code values in the scss file to match your desired color scheme. colors can be found and customized by finding the hexcode at [colorhexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/).
   - Change the `theme-skin` in `_config.yml` to `skinname`.

* If you change the theme: go to `_data/data.yml`, find the `footer:>` section at the bottom of the page and change the `updated by <a href="YOURSITE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YOUR NAME</a>` to your information.
